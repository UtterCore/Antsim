# Antsim

# Description
This is a ecosystem simulator focusing on a group of ants. The ants rely on sources of food to survive, such as berries 
and greenflies. The ants will age, mate and eventually die from starvation or age.
The simulator includes a connector for twitch so that viewers can control the simulator by using commands.

# Installation/usage
To start the simulator, simply run the jar-file. If you want to connect the simulator to a twitch account you have to create a 
txt-file called "twitchpass.txt" containing your twitch authentication token. If there is no such file the simulator will run without 
twitch command support.
